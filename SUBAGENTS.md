## Goose Subagent Implementation

Each subagent will be implemented as a separate Goose recipe, with the following structure:

```javascript
// Example Goose subagent recipe (physics-subagent.js)
{
  name: "Physics Subagent",
  description: "Implements the physics system for Marble Tilt game",
  prompts: [
    {
      role: "system",
      content: `You are a Physics Subagent for the Marble Tilt game. 
      Your task is to implement and optimize the physics system for marble movement,
      collision detection, and interactions with game elements.
      
      You have access to the following project files:
      - src/client/hooks/useGamePhysics.ts
      - src/client/utils/physics.ts
      - src/client/components/Marble/Marble.tsx
      
      Your goal is to implement realistic and performant physics that work well
      with the device orientation controls.`
    },
    {
      role: "user",
      content: "Implement the collision detection system for marbles and obstacles."
    }
  ],
  tools: [
    "file_operations",
    "code_execution",
    "terminal"
  ]
}
```

## Coordination Between Subagents

Subagents will coordinate through:

1. **Shared Documentation**: Detailed specifications and API contracts
2. **Code Comments**: Clear documentation in code
3. **Interface Definitions**: TypeScript interfaces for shared data structures
4. **Orchestration**: A main Goose agent that oversees and coordinates subagents

## Execution Strategy

For the hackathon, we'll use the following execution strategy:

1. **Parallel Development**: Run multiple subagents simultaneously on different aspects
2. **Periodic Integration**: Regularly merge subagent outputs
3. **Milestone-Based Coordination**: Coordinate subagents at key milestones
4. **Prioritized Tasks**: Focus on core functionality first (device orientation, basic multiplayer)

## Success Metrics

We'll measure subagent success based on:

1. **Feature Completeness**: Implementation of assigned tasks
2. **Code Quality**: Readability, maintainability, and adherence to best practices
3. **Performance**: Efficient execution and resource usage
4. **Integration**: Smooth integration with other subagent outputs
5. **User Experience**: Final gameplay feel and responsiveness

## Conclusion

Using Goose subagents will allow us to parallelize development and leverage specialized expertise for different aspects of the game. Each subagent can focus deeply on its domain while maintaining coordination through shared interfaces and documentation.

This approach aligns perfectly with the hackathon requirement to use Goose subagents and will result in a more efficient development process with higher quality results.
