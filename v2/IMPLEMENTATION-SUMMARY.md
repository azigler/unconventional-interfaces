## How the Store Works

The store is now integrated directly into the marble world. Here's how it works:

1. Store items are displayed as colored circles with prices in the marble world
2. When a player's marble rolls over an item, it's added to their cart
3. A notification appears confirming the item was added
4. The cart UI shows in the top-left corner with items and total price
5. Item data is stored in Firebase via the addItemToCart function

This approach creates a more integrated and intuitive experience where players can collect items while playing, rather than having to navigate to a separate store view.

## Next Steps

- Implement functionality for the collected items (e.g., actually boost speed)
- Add more store items and categories
- Add animations when collecting items
- Add save/load functionality for cart items
