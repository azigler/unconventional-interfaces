# Marble Movement Fix

## Overview of Changes

We've made several improvements to fix the marble rolling issues where marbles were "spazzing out" on the screen:

1. **Changed Physics Approach**:
   - Replaced direct velocity control with incremental force application
   - Added physics damping to prevent uncontrolled acceleration
   - Improved physics parameters (friction, restitution, density)
   - Added maximum speed cap

2. **Added Debugging Tools**:
   - Created a debug overlay system
   - Added tracing for orientation data, physics state, and server updates
   - Created controls to enable/disable debugging

3. **Key Physics Parameter Changes**:
   - Increased marble density (0.001 → 0.005)
   - Decreased bounciness (restitution 0.8 → 0.7)
   - Increased friction (0.01 → 0.05)
   - Added force magnitude limitation

## Technical Details

1. **Force Application**:
   The core issue was that we were directly setting velocity based on tilt angle, which caused jerky movements. Now we:
   - Apply a small force in the direction of tilt
   - Cap the maximum force to prevent extreme acceleration
   - Add friction/damping to simulate real-world physics
   - Cap maximum speed to ensure control

2. **Server Updates**:
   We've improved server position update logic to:
   - Include proper velocity calculation
   - Add debugging for server updates
   - Track position deltas for smoother transitions

3. **How to Test**:
   - Open the game and navigate to the local view
   - Enable "Show Debug Info" button
   - Use the "Enable All Debugging" button to see console output
   - Tilt the device to see how forces are applied
   - Observe the marble's movement - it should now roll naturally
   
## Future Improvements

For further refinement, consider:
1. Fine-tuning the force multiplier (currently 0.005)
2. Adjusting the friction factor (currently 0.99)
3. Customizing the maximum speed cap (currently 10)
4. Adding configurable physics parameters in the UI

These changes should provide a much more natural and controllable marble rolling experience.
