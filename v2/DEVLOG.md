# Marble Game Development Log

## 2023-09-03: Integrated Store Functionality into Main Game World

### Changes Made:

1. **Removed Separate Store View**
   - Eliminated the standalone store page for a more integrated experience
   - Combined marble world and store functionality into a single unified component

2. **Created MarbleWorldStore Component**
   - Built a new component that extends the existing MarbleWorld functionality
   - Added store items that players can collect by rolling over them
   - Implemented visual feedback when items are added to cart
   - Added a cart UI to display collected items and total price

3. **Updated Game Context**
   - Added cart functionality to the main game context
   - Integrated the addItemToCart function from Firebase to persist cart data

4. **Updated LocalView**
   - Changed LocalView to use the new MarbleWorldStore component
   - Adjusted layout and height to accommodate store items
   - Renamed header from "Marble Tilt" to "Marble Store"
   - Removed the "Visit Store" button since store is now integrated

5. **Fixed Routing**
   - Removed the separate /store route from App.tsx
   - Streamlined application navigation

### Technical Details:

- **Store Items**: Implemented as static circular bodies in the physics world with the isSensor property to allow marbles to pass through them
- **Collision Detection**: Used Matter.js collision events to detect when a player's marble collides with a store item
- **Cart Management**: Added local and server-side cart state management
- **Visual Design**: Color-coded store items by category and added price tags and item names

### Next Steps:

- Add more store items with varied effects
- Implement item purchase and application (e.g., actually increase marble speed when Speed Boost is purchased)
- Add more visual polish to the store items and cart UI
- Consider adding sound effects for item collection (currently prepared but not implemented)
