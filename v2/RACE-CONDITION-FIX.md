# Marble Store World Race Condition Fix

## Problem Description

The marble store world was experiencing a race condition that made the game unplayable. The issue was in the update cycle where:

1. The orientation data triggered physics updates
2. Physics updates caused position changes
3. Position changes triggered state updates
4. State updates caused screen refreshes
5. Screen refreshes triggered more position checks and updates
6. This created an infinite loop of updates, causing performance issues and erratic behavior

## Solution

The fix involves breaking the tight update cycle by throttling position updates and optimizing collision detection:

### 1. In MarbleStoreWorld.tsx:
- Added time-based throttling for position updates
- Only update position state at controlled intervals (100ms)
- This prevents rapid re-renders that would trigger the race condition

```javascript
// Throttle position updates to avoid rapid state changes
let lastPositionUpdateTime = 0;
const positionUpdateInterval = 100; // Only update position state every 100ms

// Only update position state at throttled intervals to prevent re-render loops
const now = performance.now();
if (now - lastPositionUpdateTime > positionUpdateInterval) {
  lastPositionUpdateTime = now;
  // Update current player position for collision detection
  setCurrentPlayerPosition({
    x: currentPlayerBody.position.x - width / 2,
    y: currentPlayerBody.position.y - height / 2
  });
}
```

### 2. In StoreMap.tsx:
- Optimized the collision detection dependency array
- Removed unnecessary dependencies from the useEffect that checks for collisions
- Made collision detection more efficient by filtering items upfront
- Avoided rechecking items already in the cart

```javascript
// Create a local copy of the storeItems to avoid race conditions
const itemsToCheck = storeItems.filter(item => !addedToCart[item.id]);

// Return early if no items to check
if (itemsToCheck.length === 0) return;
```

## Benefits

- Smoother gameplay with natural marble physics
- Eliminated the race condition that made the game unplayable
- Improved performance by reducing unnecessary renders
- Maintained all game functionality while fixing the underlying issue

## Testing

The game should now:
1. Allow smooth movement of marbles using device orientation
2. Let players collect items without performance issues
3. Update the cart properly when items are collected
4. Maintain physics simulation accuracy without jitter or stutter

This fix preserves all the game's functionality while preventing the race condition from occurring.
